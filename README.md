This is a chrome extension built using html,css and JS

<p> At a very basic level, a Chrome extension is just some HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows you to add some functionality to Chrome through some of the JavaScript APIs Chrome exposes. An extension is basically just a web page that is hosted within Chrome and can access some additional APIs.


This kind of extension puts a button in the Chrome toolbar that will show an HTML page when clicked and executes some JavaScript.
